File.readline reads a single line from a file. A newline character \n is left at the end of a string, and is only omitted in the last line of the file if the file doesn't end in a newline.

String.strip returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. The chars argument is a tring specifying characters to be removed.
